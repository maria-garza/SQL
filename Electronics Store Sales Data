# In this SQL, I'm querying an electronics store's database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customers and order data.

#1. How many sales were there in January?  This query accounted for unclean data in the Order ID column.
'Select orderID
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';'

#2. How many of those January orders were an iPhone? 
'Select orderID
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where product = 'iPhone'
and length(orderID)=6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';'

3#. What were the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in January? - I used an inner join to match order ID's across two tables. 
'select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers
inner join BIT_DB.JanSales
on Customers.order_id = JanSales.orderID
where length(order_ID)= 6
and order_id <> 'Order ID''

#4. What was the cheapest product sold in January, and what was the price? - I used a nested query in order to find the lowest price of a product. 
'select distinct product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where price in (select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);'

#5. What was the total revenue for each product sold in January?
'select sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product'

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
'select sum(Quantity), Product, sum(Quantity)* price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by Product'

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
'SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID''
