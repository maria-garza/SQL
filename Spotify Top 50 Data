# For this project, I downloaded Spotify top 50 data from Kaggle. 
#I added a table to BIT_DB database.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

# This is how I added the table into the database:
'CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );'

# I then imported the table as a .CSV file. 

# I explored the data using the following SQL:

# I was most curious about which artist had the most amount of songs on Spotify's top 50. 
'select artist_name, count(track_id) as Number_of_tracks
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by Nunber_of_tracks desc;'

# Next, I wanted to find what were the top 5 songs based on popularity.
'select artist_name, track_name, popularity
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
limit 5'

# I was curious what the average popularity and average danceablitity was by artist, so I wrote the following script:
'select artist_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name;'
